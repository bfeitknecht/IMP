# IMP

This is an interpreter for the imperative toy language `IMP` from the course *Formal Methods and Functional Programming* at ETHZ. It is published under the MIT license and pull requests of any kind are very welcome.


## Usage

To start the REPL, just run `imp` with no arguments. Pass the relative path of an `IMP` source file as argument to interpret it. Directly execute a statement with the `-c` / `--command` option. All variables are initialized to zero. Find some sample programms under `examples/`.


## Installation

This is a work in progress. Build artifacts for macOS, Linux and Windows *should* be available under the GitHub releases page.
